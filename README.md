The project that  I consisted of working with as an Al developer for gaming company. The gaming company developed a treasure hunt game where the player needs to find the treasure before the pirate. My job was to create a deep Q-learning algortithm from the starter code given to train the pirate to find the their way through the sample environement, different pathways, and obstacles to get to the treasure. A computer scientist specializes in the research and development of computer hardware and software, while creating new ideas and perspectives related to computer science. When approaching a problem as a computer scientist it is best to analyze and understand the problem then find a resolution. My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the origanization is to make sure I meet both of there needs.
